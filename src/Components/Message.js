          The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel by the English
          author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the world at
          some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to
          Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed
          into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The
          Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with
          over 150 million copies sold.
